# ShopEase - A React Product Management App

**ShopEase** is a product management application built with React, designed for adding, editing, deleting, and viewing products. Originally developed with the FakeStoreAPI, the project now relies on local storage to persist data, ensuring product details remain intact even after refreshing the page. This app is an excellent learning tool for React beginners, covering key concepts like API integration, routing, and context for state management.
